Hi there, thanks for visiting my page. My first landing page in github pages. 

Notes from the creator of the template.
	CSS:

		Look for this line in css/style.css (line 108 as of this writing):

			background: #348cb2 url("images/bg.jpg") bottom left;

		and use it to set the page background color, URL, and placement of
		your image. It should be as close to 1500px wide as you can get it.

	Sass:

		Set the value of $bg to the page background color, URL, and placement
		of your image. Change $bg-width if your image is something other than
		1500px wide.
